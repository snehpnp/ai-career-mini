Use time-blocking or the Pomodoro technique to schedule productive work, learning, and leisure—limit passive screen time and implement a digital sunset routine. 3. Dedicate 30 minutes daily to physical activity and take 5-10 minute screen breaks each hour. 4. Approach trading with discipline: set strict loss limits, document your process, and never risk more than you can afford. 5. Learn strategically: master one new skill (e.g., advanced video editing) per quarter, and document your progress. 6. Blend learning and leisure—analyze storytelling and editing in your favorite shows/movies for YouTube inspiration. 7. Make time for offline hobbies and social interaction to recharge creativity and prevent burnout. 8. Reflect monthly on your progress towards 3-year goals, adjust where needed, and celebrate small wins. Remember: sustainable success is built on daily small efforts, balance, and self-care. You’re well-positioned to succeed—stay focused, keep learning, and enjoy the journey!"

Prioritize health: Incorporate at least 30 minutes of daily physical activity to boost creativity and energy. 4. Manage trading/gaming mindfully: Set clear time and money limits, treat trading as a skill, and keep a log of your activities. 5. Learn with purpose: Pick a new skill every 3–6 months, document progress, and consider sharing your journey online. 6.
